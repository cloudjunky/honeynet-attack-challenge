## Usage

python challenge.py -r attack-trace.pcap

## Output

Check output.txt. With all dependencies added you should get the same.

## Installing the dependences.

If you don't want to worry about running challenge.py just ready output.txt ;)

I used a vagrant box for this as the dependencies are tricky. requirements.txt takes care of the python side.
